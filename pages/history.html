                    <h2>30s-Legend</h2>
                    <p>During this period, Bob Marley became a global icon of reggae and the Rastafarian movement.
                        In 1976, he survived an assassination attempt at his home in Kingston, but this did not deter
                        him in
                        his music career.
                        In 1977, The Wailers released the album "Exodus", featuring hits like "Jamming" and "Three
                        Little
                        Birds".
                        Despite his rising fame, Marley battled cancer that had spread throughout his body. Nonetheless,
                        he
                        continued to perform and promote peace and unity through his music.
                        Bob Marley passed away on May 11, 1981, at the age of 36, in Miami, Florida, due to
                        complications
                        related to cancer. His legacy endures as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th
                        century.

                    <h2>20s-30s</h2>
                    <p>During this decade, Bob Marley and The Wailers emerged as prominent figures in the Jamaican music
                        scene.
                        In 1972, they signed with Island Records and released their first international album, "Catch a
                        Fire".
                        Marley became an advocate for the Rastafarian movement, and his music began to reflect his
                        spiritual
                        and political beliefs.
                        In 1974, The Wailers released the album "Natty Dread", which included hits like "No Woman, No
                        Cry"
                        and "Revolution".</p>

                    <p>In 1957, Bob Marley moved to Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, where he lived with his mother.
                        During his teenage years, he became even more interested in music and formed his first band, The
                        Wailers, with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.
                        At the age of 18, Marley married Rita Anderson and worked various jobs to support his family
                        while
                        continuing his music career.</p>

                        During this time, Marley showed early interest in music and began experimenting with the guitar.

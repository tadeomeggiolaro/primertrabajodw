                <p>During this period, Bob Marley became a global icon of reggae and the Rastafarian movement.
                    In 1976, he survived an assassination attempt at his home in Kingston, but this did not deter him in his music career.
                    In 1977, The Wailers released the album "Exodus", featuring hits like "Jamming" and "Three Little Birds".
                    Despite his rising fame, Marley battled cancer that had spread throughout his body. Nonetheless, he continued to perform and promote peace and unity through his music.
                    Bob Marley passed away on May 11, 1981, at the age of 36, in Miami, Florida, due to complications related to cancer. His legacy endures as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century.</p></div>

                    Marley became an advocate for the Rastafarian movement, and his music began to reflect his spiritual and political beliefs.
